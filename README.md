# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.




# How to run this site
- download the project or clone it from the git ripo
- open the index.html file in a browser 
- make sure all the seven tests run and you don't get green
- if you get red in one of the tests, go back and refactor or check your internet connection
